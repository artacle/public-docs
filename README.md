## Motivation <a href="#artu-points" id="artu-points"></a>

​Digital art is fantastic from every angle. It's attracted newcomers to the art world, allowing them to become co-creators with emotional connections during the minting process, fostering catharsis, crafting new narratives and building communities. It already holds historical significance, regardless of what the future holds. And surely a lot of dopamine!

But there's a catch. Being crypto, once high expectations are set, it demands proper maintenance and scaling to retain attention.

## **Initiative**

Artacle is launching a comprehensive initiative aimed at revitalizing the digital art market. This initiative includes [Art Points](art-points.md), a reward system designed to incentivize engagement within the digital art community. Art Points can be earned through various activities such as paying royalties and holding digital art.

The next step is to revolutionize the digital art economy with an [utility token](artcl-digital-art-patronage.md) that paves the way for tradeable digital art indices.

## **Overall Goal**

The overall goal of Artacle's initiative is to restore and enhance the digital art market by creating a more equipped, innovative, and engaged ecosystem. By aligning incentives with the core values of digital art, Artacle aims to elevate the digital art economy and ensure its vibrant future.
