## **Introducing Art Points**

We are launching an “Art Points'' program that seeks to reward collectors and creators who support the long term growth and sustainability of our industry.  Art Points are available to claim and earn in two categories:  long term holding of specific collections, and paying of royalties when selling or buying pieces from those collections.

It should be noted that Art Points will reward the entire digital art economy, regardless of the NFT marketplace. You can continue using your favorite marketplace, and as long as royalties are paid, you'll earn Art Points.

Please note that Art Points are non-transferable.

## **How to Earn Art Points**

For buying and selling NFTs:  All generative art collections listed in ARTCL index and all AI art collections listed in ARTCL AI index. For transactions where the paid royalties are at least 50% of the recommended royalties, the seller and buyer will be eligible for Art Points.\
\
For extended holding of NFTs:  All generative art collections listed in ARTCL index and all AI art collections listed in ARTCL AI index.

Each collection listed in the indices generates Art Points daily based on its market capitalization multiplied by a coefficient, which is adjusted algorithmically. In a nutshell, the higher the collection's floor price and the greater the number of tokens, the more Art Points it generates.

## **What is the Utility of Art Points**

Art Points are just the first phase of a multiphase strategy for value creation in the digital art ecosystem.

* [$ARTCL token](artcl-digital-art-patronage.md) airdrops. Art Points will be burned and you will be able to claim tokens.
* Redemption for Artacle PRO membership (the utility has been moved to $ARTCL)
